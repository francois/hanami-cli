# This file seeds your database with data
# You can access your repositories using the following:
#
#     book_repo = app['repos.book_repo']
#
# Then, use your repositories to instantiate seeds:
#
#     book_repo.create(
#       title: "Developing Hanami Applications",
#       author: "Tim Riley"
#     )
#
# Alternatively, use relations directly:
#
#     books = app['relations.books']
#     books.insert(title: "Developming Hanami Applications", author: "Tim Riley")
